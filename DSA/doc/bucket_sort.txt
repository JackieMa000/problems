Bucket Sort is a sorting technique that sorts the elements by first dividing the elements into several groups
called buckets. The elements inside each bucket are sorted using any of the suitable sorting algorithms or
recursively calling the same algorithm.

Several buckets are created. Each bucket is filled with a specific range of elements.
The elements inside the bucket are sorted using any other algorithm. Finally, the elements of the bucket
are gathered to get the sorted array.

The process of bucket sort can be understood as a scatter-gather approach.
The elements are first scattered into buckets then the elements of buckets are sorted.
Finally, the elements are gathered in order.

bucketSort()
  create N buckets each of which can hold a range of values
  for all the buckets
    initialize each bucket with 0 values
  for all the buckets
    put elements into buckets matching the range
  for all the buckets
    sort elements in each bucket
  gather elements from each bucket
end bucketSort

int nBuckets = (max - min + 1) / capacity + 1;
    the number of buckets we need.
    (max - min + 1); // how many 1-unit in the range
    + 1, 处理余数
